# My GitHub Portfolio

## Welcome! I am Nicolas Pedraza. 
I am a highly motivated and solution-driven Data and Mechanical Engineer, with a passion for technology and project management. Currently, I am pursuing a Professional Certificate in Data Engineering through MIT xPro, where I have sharpened my expertise in Programming Languages(Python, SQL), Database Systems(SQL, NoSQL), Data Warehousing and Visualization, REST API development, and ETL Tools. My technical skills, combined with a background in mechanical engineering, and hands-on project management, enable me to tackle complex problems and deliver impactful results.

>## Project 1: Model to Predict Housing Prices 
  In this project, I developed a housing sale price prediction model using linear regression, focusing on feature selection and correlation analysis to identify the most impactful variables. After cleaning the dataset, we used features with strong positive and negative correlations (above 0.4 or below -0.4) to predict housing prices. Missing values were handled by imputing the mean, and the selected features were used to train the linear regression model. The model's performance was evaluated using the R^2 score, which measures how well the model explains the variance in housing prices. Residual analysis, through histograms of prediction errors, showed a reasonably symmetric distribution, indicating accurate predictions with low bias. This model provides a simple yet effective approach to predicting housing prices, offering insights into key drivers of value and laying the groundwork for future improvements and applications in real estate analysis.

>## Project 2: ETL, Analysis, and Visualization of MRTS Data
  This project focuses on the analysis of the Monthly Retail Trade Survey (MRTS) data to uncover trends in U.S. retail sales across various business categories. The analysis was conducted through an ETL process, beginning with SQL installation, querying, and extraction of the MRTS data, followed by cleaning and transformation using Python. Key metrics such as total sales, percentage contributions, and rolling averages were computed for categories like food services, sporting goods, and clothing stores. The data visualization revealed key insights, including the rise in spending on sporting goods, the decline of bookstores, and the shrinking gap between men’s and women’s clothing stores in terms of contribution to retail totals. The use of rolling time windows smoothed the data, providing clearer long-term trends. This comprehensive analysis demonstrates how retail sectors have evolved, with notable shifts in consumer behavior over time.

>## Project 3: Web Server App for Flight Data
  In this project, through Strapi I designed a web server application for managing flight data using a content management system. I created structured collections for Airlines, Airports, and Flights, populated each with sample data, and used Postman to interact with the server. Through GET, POST, PUT, and DELETE requests, I demonstrated the ability to retrieve, create, update, and delete flight records. Additionally, I implemented a Python application to make GET requests to the server, verifying data retrieval through Visual Studio Code. This project highlights my skills in web server management, API requests, and practical application development using CMS and Postman.
### Tools:

>## Project 4: Books Web Application
  The My Books Web Application project is a streamlined platform designed for managing a book collection, allowing users—based on their authorization level—to browse, search, add, delete, and potentially purchase books. The application requires users to create and authenticate an account to access its features. Developed using Visual Studio Code as the IDE, the project leverages Python, HTML, and JSON for functionality and structure. The web framework was built using Flask, with authentication and authorization protocols implemented via JSON Web Tokens (JWTs) to ensure secure access control.
### Tools:
* Python
* JSON
* HTML
* Libraries: Flask, flask_jwt_extended, functools, and os
* Visual Studio Code
